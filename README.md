# XRay_Pneuomonia_CNN
This project attempts to distinguish between healthy lung X-Rays and lung X-Rays of subjects with Pneumonia.
This is done using convolutional neural networks.

Initially, to learn how a CNN works,a CNN was designed to determine whether or not hortensia flowers were present in a bush.

Having learned the functioning of a CNN, a new CNN architecture was designed for the X-Ray dataset.

Details of the project and code, and information about organizing the data into train, test and validation sets is provided in the 
document titled CNN_Xray_Report.pdf

The following datasets were used for developing this project. Deta

The Hortensia Dataset â€“ https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition
